## About me

Hello. My name is Sung-Yub Kim.
I am a graduate student in [MS/Optimization Lab in SNU](http://polytope.snu.ac.kr).
My interests are Reinforcement Learning(especially entropy-regularized RL), Bayesian Deep Learning.
I will post here about those subjects.

If you have any issue on my posts or relevant subjects, pleas mail to <edmophia@snu.ac.kr>.
